# CIS221 Text

This is the text for the Cochise College CIS 221 (Digital Logic) class. This is an undergraduate class for non-engineering students who need an introduction to digital logic that is not mathematics heavy.

The text contains these chapters:

1. Introduction
2. Foundations of Binary Mathematics
3. Binary Mathematics Operations
4. Boolean Functions
5. Boolean Expressions
6. Karnaugh Maps
7. Advanced Simplifying Methods
8. Combinational Logic Circuits
9. Sequential Logic Circuits
10. Simulation

The text can be used as a stand-alone volume for digital logic classes but it was designed to be paired with a Logisim-Evolution lab manual, available at http://bit.ly/2uNYnvv.

The author is happy to share this work and would be happy to collaborate with other instructors to improve this work.

History:

* 2012\. Prior to 2012, handouts were given to students as they were needed during class; however, it was in this year that the numerous disparate documents were assembled into a cohesive book and printed by a professional printing company.
* 2013\. A number of complex circuits were added to the book, including a Hamming Code generator/checker, which is used for error detection, and a Central Processing Unit (CPU) using discrete logic gates.
* 2014\. New material on Mealy and Moore State Machines was included, but the major change was in the laboratory exercises where five Verilog labs were added to the ten gate-level simulation labs.
* 2015\. New information was added about adding/subtracting Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) numbers and representing floating point numbers in binary form; and all of the laboratory exercises were re-written in Verilog. Also, the book was reorganized and converted to LATEXfor printing.
* 2018\. The labs were re-written using Logisim-evolution because students find that system easier to understand than iVerilog.
