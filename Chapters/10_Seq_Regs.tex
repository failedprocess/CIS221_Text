	Flip-flops are the smallest possible memory available for a digital device. A flip-flop can store a single bit of data and ``remembers'' if that bit is on or off. Flip-flops are combined in groups of eight or more to create a register, which is a memory device for a byte or word of data in a system. The following topics are included in this chapter.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Analyzing a sequential circuit using a timing diagram
		\item Developing and using an SR latch
		\item Developing and using D, JK, Toggle, and Master-Slave flip-flops
		\item Designing memory components with registers
		\item Converting data between serial and parallel formats using registers
	\end{itemize}

\section{Timing Diagrams}
\label{SL:sec:timing_diagrams}

Unlike combinational logic circuits, timing is essential in sequential circuits. Normally, a device will include a \emph{clock} \gls{ic} that generates a square wave that is used to control the sequencing of various activities throughout the device. In order to design and troubleshoot these types of circuits, a timing diagram is developed that shows the relationship between the various input, intermediate, and output signals. Figure \ref{tmg:09_01} is an example timing diagram.

  \label{tmg:09_01}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{tmg:09_01} is a timing diagram for a device that has three signals, a clock, an Input, and an Output. 

\begin{itemize}
  \marginpar{Signals in a timing diagram can be described as low//high, $ 0 $//$ 1 $, on//off, or any other number of ways.}

  \item \textsc{\#}: The first line of the timing diagram is only a counter that indicates the number of times the system clock has cycled from Low to High and back again. For example, the first time the clock changes from Low to High is the beginning of the first cycle. This counter is only used to facilitate a discussion about the circuit timing. 

  \item \textsc{Clk}: A clock signal regularly varies between Low and High in a predictable pattern, normally such that the amount of Low time is the same as the High time. In a circuit, a clock pulse is frequently generated by applying voltage to a crystal since the oscillation cycle of a crystal is well known and extremely stable. In Figure \ref{tmg:09_01} the clock cycle is said have a $ 50 $\% duty cycle, that is, half-low and half-high. The exact length of a single cycle would be measured in micro- or nano-seconds but for the purposes of this book all that matters is the relationship between the various signals, not the specific length of a clock cycle.
  
  \item \textsc{In}: The input is Low until Cycle \#$ 1 $, then goes High for one cycle. It then toggles between High and Low at irregular intervals.
  
  \item \textsc{Out}: The output goes High at the beginning of cycle \#$ 1 $. It then follows the input, but only at the start of a clock cycle. Notice that the input goes high halfway through cycle \#$ 2 $ but the output does not go high until the start of cycle \#$ 3 $. Most devices are manufactured to be \emph{edge triggered} and will only change their output at either the positive or negative edge of the clock cycle (this example is positive edge triggered). Thus, notice that no matter when the input toggles the output only changes when the clock transitions from Low to High.

\end{itemize}

Given the timing diagram in Figure \ref{tmg:09_01} it would be relatively easy to build a circuit to match the timing requirements. It would have a single input and output port and the output would match the input on the positive edge of a clock cycle.

Whenever the input for any device changes it takes a tiny, but measurable, amount of time for the output to change since the various transistors, capacitors, and other electronic elements must reach saturation and begin to conduct current. This lag in response is known as \emph{propagation delay} and that is important for an engineer to consider when building a circuit. \marginpar{Ideal circuits with no propagation delay are assumed in this book in order to focus on digital logic rather than engineering.} It is possible to have a circuit that is so complex that the output has still not changed from a previous input signal before a new input signal arrives and starts the process over. In Figure \ref{tmg:09_02} notice that the output goes High when the input goes Low, but only after a tiny propagation delay.

It is also true that a square wave is not exactly square. Due to the presence of capacitors and inductors in circuits, a square wave will actually build up and decay over time rather than instantly change. Figure \ref{drw:09_01} shows a typical charge/discharge cycle for a capacitance circuit and the resulting deformation of a square wave. It should be kept in mind, though, that the times involved for capacitance charge/discharge are quite small (measured in nanoseconds or smaller); so for all but the most sensitive of applications, square waves are assumed to be truly square.

All devices are manufactured with certain tolerance levels built-in such that when the voltage gets ``close'' to the required level then the device will react, thus mitigating the effect of the deformed square wave. Also, for applications where speed is critical, such as space exploration or medical, high-speed devices are available that both sharpen the edges of the square wave and reduce propagation delay significantly.

\section{Flip-Flops}
\label{SL:sec:flip-flops}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{SL:subsec:intro_to_flip-flops}

Flip-flops are digital circuits that can maintain an electronic state even after the initial signal is removed. They are, then, the simplest of memory devices. Flip-flops are often called \emph{latches} since they are able to ``latch'' and hold some electronic state. In general, devices are called flip-flops when sequential logic is used and the output only changes on a clock pulse and they are called latches when combinational logic is used and the output constantly reacts to the input. Commonly, flip-flops are used for clocked devices, like counters, while latches are used for storage. However, these terms are often considered synonymous and are used interchangeably.

\subsection{SR Latch}
\label{SL:subsec:sr_latch}

One of the simplest of the flip-flops is the SR (for \emph{Set-Reset}) latch. \marginpar{This latch is often also called an \emph{RS Latch}.} Figure \ref{fig:09_01} illustrates a logic diagram for an \emph{SR latch} built with \textsf{NAND} gates.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_01}
	\caption{SR Latch Using NAND Gates}
	\label{fig:09_01}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab:09_01} is the truth table for an \emph{SR Latch}. Notice that unlike truth tables used earlier in this book, some of the outputs are listed as ``Last Q'' since they do not change from the previous state.

\begin{table}[H]
  \sffamily
  \newcommand{\head}[1]{\textcolor{white}{\textbf{#1}}}

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Truth Table for SR Latch}
  \label{tab:09_01}
\end{table}

In Figure \ref{fig:09_01}, input \emph{E} is an enable and must be high for the latch to work; when it is low then the output state remains constant regardless of how inputs \emph{S} or \emph{R} change. When the latch is enabled, if $ S=R=0 $ then the values of \emph{Q} and \emph{Q'} remain fixed at their last value; or, the circuit is ``remembering'' how they were previously set. When input \emph{S} goes high, then \emph{Q} goes high (the latch's output, \emph{Q}, is ``set''). When input \emph{R} goes high, then \emph{Q'} goes high (the latch's output, \emph{Q}, is ``reset''). Finally, it is important that in this latch inputs \emph{R} and \emph{S} cannot both be high when the latch is enabled or the circuit becomes unstable and output \emph{Q} will oscillate between high and low as fast as the \textsf{NAND} gates can change; thus, input $ 111_2 $ must be avoided. Normally, there is an additional bit of circuit prior to the inputs to ensure \emph{S} and \emph{R} will always be different (an \textsf{XOR} gate could do that job).

An SR Latch may or may not include a clock input; if not, then the outputs change immediately when any of the inputs change, like in a combinational circuit. If the designer needs a clocked type of memory device, which is routine, then the typical choice would be a \emph{JK Flip-Flop}, covered later. Figure \ref{tmg:09_03} is a timing diagram for the SR Latch in Listing \ref{fig:09_01}.

  \caption{SR Latch Timing Diagram} 
  \label{tmg:09_03}
\end{figure}

At the start of Figure \ref{tmg:09_03} \emph{Enable} is low and there is no change in $ Q $ and $ Q' $ until frame 3, when \emph{Enable} goes high. At that point, $ S $ is high and $ R $ is low so $ Q $ is high and $ Q' $ is low. At frame $ 4 $ both $ S $ and $ R $ are low so there is no change in $ Q $ or $ Q' $. At frame 5 $ R $ goes high so $ Q $ goes low and $ Q' $ goes high. In frame $ 6 $ both $ S $ and $ R $ are high so both $ Q $ and $ Q' $ go low. Finally, in frame $ 7 $ $ S $ stays high and $ R $ goes low so $ Q $ goes high and $ Q' $ stays low.

\Le includes an \emph{S-R Flip-Flop} device, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:09_02}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_02}
	\caption{SR Latch}
	\label{fig:09_02}
\end{figure}

The \emph{S-R Flip-Flop} has \emph{S} and \emph{R} input ports and \emph{Q} and \emph{Q'} output ports. Also notice that there is no \emph{Enable} input but there is a \emph{Clock} input.\marginpar{On a logic diagram a clock input is indicated with a triangle symbol.} Because this is a clocked device the output would only change on the edge of a clock pulse and that makes the device a flip-flop rather than a latch. As shown, \emph{S} is high and the clock has pulsed so \emph{Q} is high, or the flip-flop is ``set.'' Also notice that on the top and bottom of the device there is an \emph{S} and \emph{R} input port that are not connected. These are ``preset'' inputs that let the designer hard-set output \emph{Q} at either one or zero, which is useful during a power-up routine. Since this device has no \emph{Enable} input it is possible to use the \emph{R} preset port as a type of enable. If a high is present on the \emph{R} preset then output \emph{Q} will go low and stay there until the \emph{R} preset returns to a low state.

\subsection{Data (D) Flip-Flop}
\label{SL:subsec:data_latch}

A Data Flip-Flop (or \emph{D Flip-Flop}) is formed when the inputs for an \emph{SR Flip-Flop} are tied together through an inverter (which also means that \emph{S} and \emph{R} cannot be high at the same time, which corrects the potential problem with two high inputs in an \emph{SR Flip-Flop}). Figure \ref{fig:09_03} illustrates an \emph{SR Flip-Flop} being used as a \emph{D Flip-Flop} in \Le. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_03}
	\caption{D Flip-Flop Using SR Flip-Flop}
	\label{fig:09_03}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:09_03}, the \emph{D} input (for ``Data'') is latched and held on each clock cycle. Even though Figure \ref{fig:09_03} shows the inverter external to the latch circuit, in reality, a \emph{D Flip-Flop} device bundles everything into a single package with only \emph{D} and clock inputs and \emph{Q} and \emph{Q'} outputs, as in Figure \ref{fig:09_04}. Like the \emph{RS Flip-Flop}, \emph{D Flip-Flops} also have ``preset'' inputs on the top and bottom that lets the designer hard-set output \emph{Q} at either one or zero, which is useful during a power-up routine.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_04}

	\label{fig:09_04}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{tmg:09_04} is the timing diagram for a Data Flip-Flop.

    % \vertlines[]{}
    \tablerules[]
  \end{tikztimingtable}
  \caption{D Latch Timing Diagram} 
  \label{tmg:09_04}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{tmg:09_04} it is evident that output \emph{Q} follows input \emph{D} but only on a positive clock edge. The latch ``remembers'' the value of \emph{D} until the next clock pulse no matter how it changes between pulses. 

\subsection{JK Flip-Flop}
\label{SL:subsec:jk_flip-flop}

The \emph{JK flip-flop} is the ``workhorse'' of the flip-flop family. Figure \ref{fig:09_05} is the logic diagram for a \emph{JK flip-flop}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_05}
	\caption{JK Flip-Flop}
	\label{fig:09_05}
\end{figure}

Internally, a \emph{JK flip-flop} is similar to an \emph{RS Latch}. However, the outputs to the circuit (\emph{Q} and \emph{Q'}) are connected to the inputs (\emph{J} and \emph{K}) in such a way that the unstable input condition (both \emph{R} and \emph{S} high) of the \emph{RS Latch} is corrected. If both inputs, \emph{J} and \emph{K}, are high then the outputs are toggled (they are ``flip-flopped'') on the next clock pulse. This toggle feature makes the \emph{JK flip-flop} extremely useful in many logic circuits.

Figure \ref{tmg:09_05} is the timing diagram for a \emph{JK flip-flop}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikztimingtable}[

  \end{tikztimingtable}
  \caption{JK Flip-Flop Timing Diagram} 
  \label{tmg:09_05}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab:09_01} summarizes timing diagram \ref{tmg:09_05}. Notice that on clock pulse five both \emph{J} and \emph{K} are high so \emph{Q} toggles. Also notice that \emph{Q'} is not indicated in the table since it is always just the complement of \emph{Q}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Toggle (T) Flip-Flop}
\label{SL:subsec:toggle_flip-flop}

If the J and K inputs to a \emph{JK Flip-Flop} are tied together, then when the input is high the output will toggle on every clock pulse but when the input is Low then the output remains in the previous state. This is often referred to as a \emph{Toggle Flip-Flop} (or \emph{T Flip-Flop}). \emph{T Flip-Flops} are not usually found in circuits as separate \glspl{ic} since they are so easily created by soldering together the inputs of a standard \emph{JK Flip-Flop}. Figure \ref{fig:09_06} is a \emph{T Flip-Flop} in \Le.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Toggle Flip-Flop Timing Diagram} 
  \label{tmg:09_06}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{tmg:09_06} when \emph{D}, the data input, is high then \emph{Q} toggles on the positive edge of every clock cycle.

\subsection{Master-Slave Flip-Flops}
\label{SL:subsec:master-slave_flip-flops}

Master-Slave Flip-Flops are two flip-flops connected in a cascade and operating from the same clock pulse. These flip-flops tend to stabilize an input circuit and are used where the inputs may have voltage glitches (such as from a push button). Figure \ref{fig:09_07} is the logic diagram for two \emph{JK flip-flops} set up as a Master-Slave Flip-Flop.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_07}
	\caption{Master-Slave Flip-Flop}
	\label{fig:09_07}
\end{figure}

Because of the \textsf{NOT} gate on the clock signal these two flip-flops will activate on opposite clock pulses, which means the flip-flop one will enable first and read the JK inputs, then flip-flop two will enable and read the output of flip-flop one. The result is that any glitches on the input signals will tend to be eliminated.

Often, only one physical \gls{ic} is needed to provide the two flip-flops for a master-slave circuit because dual \emph{JK flip-flops} are frequently found on a single \gls{ic}. Thus, the output pins for one flip-flop could be connected directly to the input pins for the second flip-flop on the same \gls{ic}. By combining two flip-flops into a single \gls{ic} package, circuit design can be simplified and fewer components need to be purchased and mounted on a circuit board.

\section{Registers}
\label{SL:sec:registers}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{SL:subsec:intro_to_registers}

A register is a simple memory device that is composed of a series of flip-flops wired together such that they share a common clock pulse. Registers come in various sizes and types and are often used as ``scratch pads'' for devices. For example, a register can hold a number entered on a keypad until the calculation circuit is ready do something with that number or a register can hold a byte of data coming from a hard drive until the \gls{cpu} is ready to move that data someplace else. 

\subsection{Registers As Memory}
\label{SL:subsec:registers_as_memory}

Internally, a register is constructed from \emph{D Flip-Flops} as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:09_08}.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_08}
	\caption{4-Bit Register}
	\label{fig:09_08}
\end{figure}

Data are moved from the input port, in the upper left corner, into the register; one bit goes into each of the four \emph{D Flip-Flops}. Because each latch constantly outputs whatever it contains, the output port, in the lower right corner, combines the four data bits and displays the contents of the register. Thus, a four-bit register can ``remember'' some number until it is needed, it is a four-bit memory device.

\subsubsection{74x273 Eight-Bit Register}
\label{SL:subsubsec:74x273_8-bit_register}

In reality, designers do not build memory from independent flip-flops, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:09_08}. Instead, they use a memory \gls{ic} that contains the amount of memory needed. In general, purchasing a memory \gls{ic} is cheaper and more reliable than attempting to build a memory device.

One such memory device is a $ 74x273 $ eight-bit register. This device is designed to load and store a single eight-bit number, but other memory devices are much larger, including \gls{ram} that can store and retrieve millions of eight-bit bytes.

\subsection{Shift Registers}
\label{SL:subsec:shift_registers}

Registers have an important function in changing a stream of data from serial to parallel or parallel to serial; a function that is called ``shifting'' data. For example, data entering a computer from a network or \gls{usb} port is in serial form; that is, one bit at a time is streamed into or out of the computer. However, data inside the computer are always moved in parallel; that is, all of the bits in a word are placed on a bus and moved through the system simultaneously. Changing data from serial to parallel or vice-verse is an essential function and enables a computer to communicate over a serial device.

Figure \ref{fig:09_09} illustrates a four-bit parallel-in/serial-out shift register. The four-bit data into the register is placed on \emph{D0}-\emph{D3}, the \emph{Shift\_Write} bit is set to $ 1 $ and the clock is pulsed to write the data into the register. Then the \emph{Shift\_Write} bit is set to $ 0 $ and on each clock pulse the four bits are shifted right to the \emph{SOUT} (for ``serial out'') port.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{.95\linewidth}]{gfx/09_09}

	\label{fig:09_09}
\end{figure}

It is possible to also build other shift register configurations: serial-in/serial-out, parallel-in/parallel-out, and serial-in/parallel-out. However, universal shift registers are commonly used since they can be easily configured to work with data in either serial or parallel formats.
